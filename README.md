Homework 2
Made by: Alejandro Carmona S and David Restrepo A

Developed on MacOS Sonoma (14.4.1) using Visual Studio Code version 1.88.1 (Universal) with Python 3.11.2.
Tools used to complete the assingment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awXtwAFb7Wo and Dexter C. Kozen Automata and Computability.

How to run the code: 
1. open your terminal on your preference IDE
  
3. Write "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" depending on wich python version you have installed.
   
5. First write c> 0 for the number of cases you want to create, then you will write two numbers, k>0 for the number of nonterminals and m>0 for the number of strings to be analyzed (separated by a blank espace, take into account that this is only the first case); then write the nonterminal followed by its productions (the program should read k lines, the number of lines you entered above), now we do the same, but with number m of strings that we want to analize (Each line you must press enter to confirm). Now you just repeat the process with each case, until you have completed the number c of cases you wanted to create.

6. Done! Now the code will tell you if these strings are in the gramatics we have just created.
